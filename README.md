# I ASSUME NO RESPONSABILITY IF YOU GO BLIND AFTER LOOKING TO MY CODE
# BROWSE IT BY YOUR OWN RISK
# ONLY EXECUTE IT ON A COMPUTER YOU'RE ALLOWED TO EXPLODE


# example
Sample code for asynchronous, parallel multitasking systems

- Use $name instead of self.name
- Use @name to access an instance's class.name
- A better and high performance logging system
- A better debugging system
- A parallel module execution system



# SPECIAL THANKS TO MY CODE REVIEWERS
  - MY MOM (WHO SAID IT'S PERFECT ALTHOUGH SHE DIDNT ACTUALLY SEE IT)
  - MY GIRLFRIEND (WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT PROGRAMMING)
